# Cypress JS Challenge

For this Challenge I got the task to do some Test Cases.

## Installation
Using Visual Code go to terminal.
Using NPM do a ```npm install cypress```, if you don't have NPM download npm and do a ```npm install ```

## Usage
After installing all the dependencies, do a ```npx cypress open``` this will open the Cypress UI, after opening the UI click on E2E Testing, select Chrome Browser and click on Start E2E Testing in Chrome, you will get chromium for cypress. Go to Specs and click on test.cy.js and the script will start running
